My final project proposal for Programming for Digital Arts
# Title
Choose Your Own Adventure!
## Repository
<Link to your project's public GitHub respository>

## Description
This project will be a Choose Your Own Adventure styled game. The outcome of the adventure will change depending on

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The program will feature "if' statements depending on which answer the user types into the program.
- Feature 2
	- The program will also feature "elif" statements to allow for multiple conditions with different outcomes.

## Challenges
- For this lab, I'm going to have to recall on how to use "if" and "elif" statements to create an engaging, interactive experience, especially since I've struggled with this in the past.


## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome for this project is to create a fully engaging "Choose Your Adventure" game that allows for multiple outcomes depending on the choice of the user, from different types of locations that the user can traverse through to potential new powerups discovered along each type of location.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimum outcome for this project is to allow the user to have at least two outcomes depending on what the user inputs.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create the file for the final project
  2. Implement the first "if" and "elif" statements in the code.

- Week 2
  1. Begin printing fictional locations into the code that the user can encounter depending on their input
  2. Continue adding "if" and "elif" statements that further expand the adventure.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Conclude the adventure with a good or bad ending depending on the user's choice
  2. Turn in the final project
